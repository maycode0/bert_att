( my favorite moment - when norton 's character tells wahlberg 's character that he 's just lost the element of surprise . wahlberg proceeds to cold cock norton with a right cross , and then asks him , \" were you surprised ? ? \" hmmm , maybe you had to be there ... ) < br /><br />of course the movie requires a certain level of \" suspension of disbelief \" to work , but if you just relax and go along with it ( and do n't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater , or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate la traffic via a laptop , etc ) , you 'll have a fun ride . < br /><br />\"the italian job \" : it 's lightweight summer fluff , but it 's very good for what it is , and it does n't try to be anything else . it is n't good enough for an \" 8 \" but i 'd give it a \" 7.5 \" .",

[ br / / < < />and it is really 80s clich\u00e9 when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city ( rocking guitar licks or power ballet ) and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes . both of which this movie satisfies . at least this movie establishes what era it 's from which was unnecessary since sandra 's hair was screaming \" 1980s ! ! ! ! \" and a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box , which you respond to sadly saying : \" that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got . \" another hammy moment is at the beginning when some - secret - agent - dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die . all that scene needed was the mario death ditty or maybe contra sound effects but nintendo might have sued.<br /><br />and it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other better movie icons . before the big gun scene , da hero is found standing in a boxing ring ( ' rocky ' anyone ? ) , sporting a leather fedora ( not ' indiana jones ' too ) with an ominous spotlights behind him ( terminator the 2nd before owning t-1000 ) what is really really sad is that people on youtube or dailymotion can film better quality videos ( with a crappy webcam no less ) then this movie . i 'm serious , most rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie . i can not even call this movie by it 's given name for it 's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment ( a freaking violation against human rights ! ) the only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is sandra 's career started taking off thanks to this movie . but oh sandra . . . why did you have to be in such a nightmare ? the paycheck better been worth it . the dvd also graces you with a little back story on sandra as an extra , seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name . which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs , crafty little critter.<br /><br />i do n't have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it . i could bounce back from ' mazes and monsters ' with a good old campy bruce willis comedy . but not even bruce could cheer me up after this movie . i have yet to see any ed wood or uwe boll but i think i 'm amped for them now . for i ca n't even fathom a movie worse then . . . \" gag \" . . .

( gr / ] [ gr />a last note to the director i 'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi campfire . i honestly ca n't for the life of me think of one . > gr / ] [ gr / ] now on to the writing . try to make at least one character re kaable . i 'd prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help . also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story . \uff08 gr / > \uff08 s />if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it does n't contradict every single thing that comes before it . and try adding some fancy spelunker terms to a cave movie . you might have wanted to start with spelunking.<br / > [ b />the cavern is a pretty nasty film , loosely filming with a confusing , improbable and anticluma scenario ending ."

[ br /><br / > how are people committing suicide ? do we really understand their motives ? or are we just trying to understand , after its already too late ? and why is it always someone , you would never have expected it to be?<br /><br / ] these movie does n't answer this question , but it raises it . and it does so in a very painful style . all the way it keeps you guessing , whose blood it might be , that you see at the very beginning . you are following the paths of some students , all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives , just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale.<br /><br />did you know who it would be ? or were you caught by surprise , like in real life?<br /><br / ] a message is verbalized by one of the surviving kids in the end . we are always so fixed on our own problems , we forget to see those of others . there might be someone , a colleague , a friend , who does not want to live anymore . but , if you do n't open your eyes , you 'll never know until its too late.<br /><br />this movie delivers well . it might have some flaws , but they do n't matter anymore , when its over . either you see a reflection of society , or you are blind for reality ."

pan voice - over work).<br /><br />yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis , and how one ca n't ever really imagine what it 's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in war - time . dieter , aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have ( and herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber , elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes ) , knows what it is to have to survive at all costs . but yet , as well , as in many of herzog 's protagonist driven films , there 's the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if one 's strong enough , even through horrid moments ( the fate of dunae ) and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter ( is he american , or a spy , they ask on the chopper ) . dieter is such a man with a spirit , and he 's given via herzog a fantastic , tragic , creative , well -
